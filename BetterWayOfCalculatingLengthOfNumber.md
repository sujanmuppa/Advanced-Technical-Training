# The logarithmic way to calculate the length of a number

## The length of a number is the number of digits in it. For example, the length of 123 is 3, and the length of 100 is 3. 
The proof of the above is: ```
log10(123) = 2.091
log10(100) = 2
```
The length of 123 is 3 and the length of 100 is 3.
If we need more proof: 
```
log10(1234) = 3.091
log10(1000) = 3
```

The length of 1234 is 4 and the length of 1000 is 4.

The length of a number is the floor of the logarithm of the number plus 1. 
```
length = floor(log10(number)) + 1
```

The length of a number is the floor of the logarithm of the number plus 1. 
```python
def length_of_number(number):
    return int(math.log10(number)) + 1
```
The above function will return the length of the number. 
```python
print(length_of_number(123)) # 3

print(length_of_number(100)) # 3

print(length_of_number(1234)) # 4

print(length_of_number(1000)) # 4
```

Now if we need to calculate the length of a Factorial: 
```python
def length_of_factorial(number):
    return sum([int(math.log10(i)) + 1 for i in range(1, number + 1)])
```

The above function will return the length of the factorial of the number. 
```python

print(length_of_factorial(5)) # 3

print(length_of_factorial(10)) # 7

print(length_of_factorial(15)) # 11
```
This is because of the following proof: 
```
log10(1) = 1
log10(2) = 1
log10(3) = 1
log10(4) = 1
log10(5) = 1
log10(6) = 1
log10(7) = 1
log10(8) = 1
log10(9) = 1
log10(10) = 2
log10(11) = 2
log10(12) = 2
log10(13) = 2
log10(14) = 2
log10(15) = 2
```
 
```
log10(123) = 2.091
log10(100) = 2
```
The length of 123 is 3 and the length of 100 is 3.
If we need more proof: 
```
log10(1234) = 3.091
log10(1000) = 3
```

The length of 1234 is 4 and the length of 1000 is 4.

The length of a number is the floor of the logarithm of the number plus 1. 
```
length = floor(log10(number)) + 1
```

The length of a number is the floor of the logarithm of the number plus 1. 
```python
def length_of_number(number):
    return int(math.log10(number)) + 1
```
The above function will return the length of the number. 
```python
print(length_of_number(123)) # 3

print(length_of_number(100)) # 3

print(length_of_number(1234)) # 4

print(length_of_number(1000)) # 4
```

Now if we need to calculate the length of a Factorial: 
```python
def length_of_factorial(number):
    return sum([int(math.log10(i)) + 1 for i in range(1, number + 1)])
```

The above function will return the length of the factorial of the number. 
```python

print(length_of_factorial(5)) # 3

print(length_of_factorial(10)) # 7

print(length_of_factorial(15)) # 11
```
This is because of the following proof: 
```
log10(1) = 1
log10(2) = 1
log10(3) = 1
log10(4) = 1
log10(5) = 1
log10(6) = 1
log10(7) = 1
log10(8) = 1
log10(9) = 1
log10(10) = 2
log10(11) = 2
log10(12) = 2
log10(13) = 2
log10(14) = 2
log10(15) = 2
```


The length of a number can be calculated using logarithms. The base 10 logarithm of a number gives the number of digits minus 1. For example, log10(100) = 2, which means 100 has 3 digits.

When it comes to factorials, we can use Stirling's approximation, which states that for a large number n, n! is approximately sqrt(2πn) * (n / e)^n.

The number of digits in n! can be found by taking the base 10 logarithm of n!. Using Stirling's approximation, we get:

log10(n!) = log10(sqrt(2πn) * (n / e)^n)
          = 0.5 * log10(2πn) + n * log10(n / e)
          = 0.5 * log10(2π) + 0.5 * log10(n) + n * (log10(n) - 1)
          = 0.5 * log10(2π) + 0.5 * log10(n) + n * log10(n) - n

As n becomes large, the term n * log10(n) dominates, so the number of digits in n! is approximately n * log10(n). This is an approximation and the actual number of digits may be slightly more or less.

Here's a Python function that calculates the number of digits in a factorial using this approximation:

```python
import math

def factorial_length(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    elif n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        x = n * math.log10(n / math.e) + math.log10(2 * math.pi * n) / 2.0
        return math.ceil(x)
```

This function uses the math library's log10 and pi constants, and the math.e constant for the base of the natural logarithm. It calculates the length of the factorial of n and rounds up to the nearest whole number, because the number of digits in a number is always an integer.

sujanmuppa: just apply log on both sides and give me explanation for that

GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's apply the logarithm to both sides of the Stirling's approximation and simplify it to find the number of digits in n!.

Stirling's approximation is:

n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) * (n / e)^n

Taking log base 10 on both sides:

log10(n!) ≈ log10(sqrt(2πn) * (n / e)^n)

Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify the right side:

log10(n!)

If we don't use Stirling's approximation, we can still find the number of digits in a factorial by applying the logarithm property directly to the factorial.

The number of digits in a number `n` is `floor(log10(n)) + 1`.

For a factorial, `n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1`. 

So, the number of digits in `n!` would be `floor(log10(n!)) + 1`.

Applying the property of logarithms that `log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b)`, we can say that `log10(n!) = log10(n) + log10(n-1) + log10(n-2) + ... + log10(2) + log10(1)`.

So, the number of digits in `n!` is `floor(log10(n) + log10(n-1) + log10(n-2) + ... + log10(2) + log10(1)) + 1`.

Here's a Python function that calculates the number of digits in a factorial using this method:

```python
import math

def factorial_length(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    elif n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        digits = 0
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            digits += math.log10(i)
        return math.floor(digits) + 1
```

This function sums the base 10 logarithms of all integers from 2 to `n`, then takes the floor of the sum and adds 1 to get the number of digits in `n!`.

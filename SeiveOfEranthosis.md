# Seive of Eranthosis

## Problem Statement
Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number.

Proof That the prime numbers will be of the form 6k+1 or 6k-1:

Let's assume that the number is of the form 6k. Then the number is divisible by 2 and 3.

Let's assume that the number is of the form 6k+2. Then the number is divisible by 2.

Let's assume that the number is of the form 6k+3. Then the number is divisible by 3.

Let's assume that the number is of the form 6k+4. Then the number is divisible by 2.

So, the prime numbers will be of the form 6k+1 or 6k-1.
